# TODOs

## Done
- [x] Parse data coming from http://www.ietf.org/download/rfc-index.txt into list of RFCs

## Next Up
- [ ] Handle multiple `Format` extension and lengths (e.g.`(Format: TXT=aaaaa, PS=bbbbbb bytes)`)
- [ ] Understand the metadata and the kinds of relationships that exist in it

## Possibilities
- [ ] Generate a static site (Hugo) with correlated metadata
- [ ] Output data into CSV, JSON, BoltDB formats for others to use
- [ ] Create and host JSON API (on Heroku)
